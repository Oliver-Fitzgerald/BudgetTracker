# BudgetTracker
Record income and expenditure and display to user.
Project Goals
The goal of this project is to work towards an app that will automatically budget your transactions based on your bank activity with as little input(effort) from the user as
possible. To facilitate this it should be directly linked to the users bank account and also offer suggestions on how they could decrease their expenditure or increase their 
income e.g searching for shops which offer a better price. As well as this showing trends in their expenditure. (This data may also be very valuable to certain companies if 
the user would be so kind as to provide it to us)

Project Scope
This iteration should simply be storing income and expenditure and comparing it against the total savings and taking into account how long before the user runs out of money or 
how much money they will be saving every month at the rate they are going. It should allow the user to add regular expenditure/income that will occur at regular intervals
